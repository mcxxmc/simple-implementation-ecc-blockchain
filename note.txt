The block header contains the block version number, a timestamp, the hash used in the previous block,
the hash of the Merkle Root, the nonce, and the target hash. The block is generated by taking the hash of the block
contents, adding a random string of numbers (the nonce), and hashing the block again.

The hashes on the bottom row are referred to as "leaves," the intermediate hashes as "branches," and the hash at the
top as the "root." The Merkle root of a given block is stored in the header: for example, the Merkle root of block
#482819 is e045b18e7a3d708d686717b4f44db2099aabcad9bebf968de5f7271b458f71c8. The root is combined with other information
(the software version, the previous block's hash, the timestamp, the difficulty target, and the nonce) and then run
through a hash function to produce the block's unique hash:
000000000000000000bfc767ef8bf28c42cbd4bdbafd9aa1b5c3c33c2b089594 in the case of block #482819. This hash is not actually
included in the relevant block, but the next one; it is distinct from the Merkle root.
